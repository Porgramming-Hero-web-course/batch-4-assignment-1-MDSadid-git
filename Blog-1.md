## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union and Intersection are powerful items in TypeScript. Union helps me choose which one I get. Intersection gives me 2, 3, 4, etc., which I have to use on this. Among these features, union and intersection types are particularly useful for modeling complex data structures and expressing flexible type relationships. I really enjoy using them on my project. They've helped me a lot and solved more big problems.
